The Karuna Library Management System is a Windows Forms application developed in C# that aims to streamline the management of libraries, from inventory tracking to user borrowing history. This system is designed to manage book inventories, track user accounts, and facilitate the borrowing and returning of books efficiently.

In a traditional library setting, managing books, keeping track of borrowed items, and maintaining records can become overwhelming without a digital system. This project addresses those challenges by offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Library staff can easily search for books, check availability, and manage book loans.

Key features of the system include:

Book Inventory Management: Add, update, or remove books from the inventory, complete with detailed information like title, author, publication date, and ISBN.
User Management: Register new users, update their profiles, and track borrowing history.
Loan Management: Manage the borrowing and returning of books with due dates and overdue notifications, ensuring that books are returned on time.
Search Functionality: Users and administrators can search the catalog by author, title, genre, or ISBN, providing ease of access to the systemâ€™s resources.
Reports Generation: Generate detailed reports about current inventory, most borrowed books, overdue books, and user activity.
This system is ideal for libraries looking to digitize their operations, reduce paperwork, and improve the overall experience for both staff and patrons. Additionally, it can be tailored for use in various institutions, such as schools, universities, and community libraries.
